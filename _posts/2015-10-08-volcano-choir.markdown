I’m on a constant hunt for the elusive album whose first few moments perfectly define its entirety. For me, Repave by Volcano Choir can be put on my mental-shelf next to Broken Social Scene’s S/T, and Young Machetes by The Blood Brothers (both of which will likely appear in future iterations of this column.)

It struck me while sitting behind my desk at a job (in 2013) that I was feeling increasingly fed-up with as each day passed, knee-deep in worry about my impending engagement (it took me another nine months to propose; she said yes), that Repave is in fact one of those albums that is characterized perfectly by minute one.

The first seconds of Volcano Choir’s Repave do something very intriguing. Grinding into focus, like some kind of biotic machine being powered-up for the first time in a century, the opening organ notes hum away just long enough to become dissonant, but suddenly snap back into harmony. This particular set of notes may be just seductive enough to make your church organist blush, but beneath the mystique created by an ever-growing wash of delay and Leslie cabinet, the notes feel honest. The sultry, spinning organ gives way to an unsure guitar riff that almost sounds as if Chris Rosenau is writing it just as we’re hearing it. As sudden comprehension dawns, Rosenau starts to play a revised, more fully realized version of that same guitar part. Supported by a timid, but driving kick drum, Rosenau’s guitar gives way to the commanding voice of Justin Vernon. This concept sticks around for the next 35-odd minutes as we follow Volcano Choir on what feels like an unscripted journey of self discovery.

Vernon’s daring lyricism came to me at a time when I often felt as if I were speaking another language to others both professionally and personally. Although I hadn’t yet had time to process and dissect the lyrics of Repave, I supremely appreciated his ability to convey so much with so little context. Time passed, and as most of us do, I began to apply my own meaning and definition to the lyrics contained by these songs, but for a short while, I felt less alone in my conquest for understanding. Vernon is absolutely dripping in confidence as he shifts back and forth between effortless poetry and seemingly nonsensical couplets when he sings in a quivery falsetto,
