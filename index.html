    <p>Honeycomb is the thing before the thing; a code-name for a big idea. We're building a platform to experiment with print &amp; digital journalism.</p>
    <p>We're a group of writers, designers, musicians &amp; fans that want to change the conversation around music. Honeycomb has no rules. The format and content are sure to evolve over time. In fact, we'll see to it with each new issue. Experimentation is our constant; we may even beta-test some ideas here in this space.</p>
    <p>Captivated? We know thats not much to go on. Give us your email address so we can let you know how and where you can find us. Talk soon.</p>
