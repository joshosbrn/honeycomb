    <p>Project Honeycomb is the thing before the thing; a code-name for a big idea. We're writing &amp; producing a real-life music magazine. Honeycomb has no rules. The format and content are sure to evolve over time. In fact, we'll see to it with each new issue. Experimentation is our constant; we may even beta-test some ideas here in this space. Hell.. we may even learn how to write in the process.</p>
    <p>Captivated? We know thats not much to go on. Give us your email address so we can let you know how and where you can find us. Talk soon.</p>
